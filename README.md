# Secure Notes Application: A Robust and Secure Full-Stack Solution
The Secure Notes Application is a comprehensive platform designed to ensure secure storage and management of user notes. It is built using Spring Boot for the backend and React with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, focusing on robust security, seamless user experience, and scalable deployment.

## Key Features:

1. Advanced Security Implementation:

JWT Authentication: Secure user sessions with JSON Web Tokens.
OAuth2 Integration: Seamless third-party authentication with Google and GitHub.
Multi-Factor Authentication: Enhance security with additional authentication layers.
Role-Based Access Control: Manage user roles and permissions effectively.

2. Secure API Development:

Follow best practices to develop APIs with Spring Boot.
Implement CORS and CSRF protections for frontend-backend integration.

3. User Management:

Secure password practices using encoders.
Password reset features for enhanced usability.
Role and permission management for diverse user needs.

4. Auditing and Tracking:

Include audit trails to monitor user actions for accountability and compliance.

5. Frontend-Backend Integration:

Smooth handling of CORS and JWT authentication in the React-Spring Boot ecosystem.

6. AWS Deployment:

Deploy the application on AWS, leveraging cloud best practices for scalability and reliability.

7. Technologies Used:
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security
Authentication: JWT, OAuth2
Deployment: AWS
Database: Relational or NoSQL database as needed
Version Control: Git
